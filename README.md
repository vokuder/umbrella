# Umbrella
App to display weather conditions. 


### Setup:
```
npm i
```


### Run dev server:
```
npm run dev
```


### Create a production build:
This step requires cordova and SDKs for your targeted platform. Please refer to the [cordova documentation]() for more instructions.
<br>
<br>
When running: `npm run build` the vue application source code gets minified and packaged for production into `www` directory.
<br>Cordova will pickup files from `www` if you start the build process.
